Counterwallet
================

Online Webwallet for [Counterparty](http://www.counterparty.io).

Originally based off of [Carbonwallet](http://www.carbonwallet.com) (however virtually all the original code has been removed or rewritten).


Production Systems
-------------------

* Main page: **[counterwallet.io](https://counterwallet.io/)**
* Primary server -- Mainnet: **[wallet.counterwallet.io](https://wallet.counterwallet.io/)**
* Primary server -- Testnet: **[wallet-testnet.counterwallet.io](https://wallet-testnet.counterwallet.io/)**


Features
----------

- Deterministic wallet addresses (BIP 32-based)
- Supports the majority of Counterparty functionality
- Fully-AJAX driven
- Anonymous
- Runs in the browser, with keys created in memory
- Multi-sig

Browser Support
-------------------

**Desktop**

- Chrome 23+ (preferred browser)
- Firefox 25+
- Safari 7+
- Opera 15+

Notably, Internet Explorer is **not** supported, due to its lack of full Content-Security-Policy support (even with IE 11).

**Mobile**

- IOS Safari 7+
- Android Browser 4.4+
- Chrome for Android 33+
- Chrome for iOS 35+
- Firefox for Android 26+


Build Instructions
-------------------

### Before running the build system:
```
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli bower
```

### To build:
```
cd src; bower install; cd ..
npm install
```

### To (re)build the static (i.e. minified) site:
```
grunt build
```

### To regenerate dependencies hash file (```src/.bowerhashes```):
```
grunt freeze
```

### To enable localizations (optional):
1. Create an account on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/)
2. In your home directory, create a file named `.transifex` and put your Transifex username and password into it in this format: `user:password`
3. Run `grunt build` to download translations
4. Add the languages you want to support to `AVAILABLE_LANGUAGES` in **counterwallet.conf.json** - you can use **counterwallet.conf.json.example** as a template. The template file contains **only** the setting relevant to languages and does not replace the rest of variables required in that file (refer to Federeated Node documentation for additional details about `counterwallet.conf`).

Setting up your own Counterwallet Server
-----------------------------------------

See [this link](http://counterparty.io/docs/federated_node/) for more info.

Development
-----------

The easiest way to develop locally is to install Federated Node in Docker environment. If you already have Bitcoin Core addrindex, Counterparty Server and Counterblock, then Counterwallet can be manually installed using either of these approaches:

* Stand-alone Docker environment: refer to docker\start.sh in the Counterwallet source code. 
* Manually: example based on the Docker template for Counterwallet on Ubuntu 16.04 is provided below.

### Manual installation in local environment (Ubuntu 16.04 x64):
1. Download required release or branch (optionally check Pull Requests, if any). 
2. Enter the archive directory: `cd $PATH2SOURCE`
3. Install NodeJS and create a symlink if needed: `sudo apt-get install nodejs ; sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node`
4. Prepare: `npm install -g --save-dev bower grunt-cli`
5. Download dependencies in the src subdirectory: `cd src; bower --allow-root --config.interactive=false update` 
6. Prepublish `cd $PATH2SOURCE; mkdir build ; npm update`
7. Build: Copy counterwallet.conf.json.example to counterwallet.conf.json. Use text editor to add `"http://wallet.counterwallet.io"` in between the square brackets in `servers` in counterwallet.conf.json. Then build: `grunt build --dontcheckdeps --dontminify && cp counterwallet.conf.json build/`. The application will be stored in the build subdirectory.
8. Serve: Open a seperate terminal, install serve (`sudo npm install -g serve`) and in the build subdirectory start Counterwallet service: `cd build/; serve`. 
9. Use: Visit `http://localhost:3000` (or you can specify a different port for `serve` if you like)

#### Notes:

* the `--dontcheckdeps` speeds up the process and avoids having to do `grunt freeze` everytime you make a change to a dependency during development
* the `--dontminify` makes your debugging life a bit easier
* the `cp` is neccesary because grunt keeps clearing the `build` folder
* If you want to test your local version on another device (or let another person test something) use https://ngrok.com to setup a tunnel to your local environment
* If you want to use HTTPS, refer to additional steps required in the Counterwallet Docker start script
 
### Note concerning `npm install`
`npm install` triggers a `prepublish` which is configured to do `grunt build` 
and will bork if you haven't done a `grunt freeze` after making changes to dependencies.
You can use `npm update` to circumvent this during development.

### Running tests in browser
You can run tests in your browser by doing the above steps and;
 - open a seperate terminal and [from the root of the project, not from `build/` run `serve -p 3001` (different port)
 - visit `http://localhost:3001/test/test.html`

### Running tests from CLI (using phantomjs headless browser)
 - `npm test`

### Development without a full node

To work on counterwallet without running a full node and supporting services locally, please see the scripts located in the [local development folder](local-development).
